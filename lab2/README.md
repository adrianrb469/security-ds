# Security Data Science Lab 2

This lab focuses on applying the concepts learned in the Kaggle "5-Day Generative AI" course (https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-genai) to security-related data science tasks.

## Overview

The lab is structured to mirror the Kaggle course, with each day's work contained in a corresponding directory (day1, day2, day3, and day4). Day 5 was excluded as it did not contain a practical coding assignment or lab component.

**Note:** Detailed answers to the lab questions are in the `sds-lab2.pdf` document.

## Contents

- **day1**: Contains the notebook `day-1.ipynb` covering LLM fundamentals and prompt engineering.
- **day2**: Includes notebooks on classifying embeddings with Keras:
  - `day-2-classifying-embeddings-with-keras.ipynb`
  - `day-2-document-q-a-with-rag.ipynb`
  - `day-2-embeddings-and-similarity-scores.ipynb`
- **day3**: Contains notebooks on building agents and function calling:
  - `day-3-building-an-agent-with-langgraph.ipynb`
  - `day-3-function-calling-with-the-gemini-api.ipynb`
  - `sample.db`: A sample database used in the exercises.
- **day4**: Covers fine-tuning custom models and Google Search grounding:
  - `day-4-fine-tuning-a-custom-model.ipynb`
  - `day-4-google-search-grounding.ipynb`
- **.env**: Contains environment variables (Create your own `.env` file with the required variables).
- **sd-lab2-day4-grounding.pdf**: Contains the grounding notebook for day 4.
- **sds-lab2.pdf**: Contains answers to lab questions.

## Execution

All Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb`) were executed locally. The output of each notebook, demonstrating successful runs and results, is included within the respective notebook files.

To run the notebooks yourself, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (as specified in the Kaggle course and potentially additional ones mentioned in the notebooks) and configure your `.env` file with the required environment variables.
